# PartyInvited

**Scene**  
  Imagine that a friend has decided to host a New Year’s Eve party and that she has asked me to create a web app that allows her invitees to electronically RSVP. She has asked for these four key features:  
• A home page that shows information about the party  
• A form that can be used to RSVP  
• Validation for the RSVP form, which will display a thank-you page  
• A summary page that shows who is coming to the party
